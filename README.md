- 3 sample projects across different clients
- Sample project assignments

## Development

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Starts the server with nodemon for development
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm start  # Starts the React development server
```

### Building for Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Creates optimized production build
```

## Security Features

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based route protection
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use, modify the PORT environment variable
2. **Database issues**: Delete `timesheet.db` file to reset the database with sample data
3. **CORS issues**: Ensure both frontend and backend are running on their respective ports
4. **Timesheet sync issues**: If clock-in/out data doesn't appear in admin dashboard:
   - Click "Sync Time Entries" button in admin dashboard
   - Check browser console for sync progress messages
   - Verify that time entries have valid project IDs
   - Ensure users have clocked out (not just clocked in)

### Logs
- Backend logs are displayed in the terminal where you run `npm start`
- Frontend development logs appear in the browser console
