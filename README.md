- **projects**: Project information including client and work details
- **user_projects**: Many-to-many relationship between users and projects
- **timesheets**: Time entries with daily hour breakdowns

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - User login

### User Endpoints
- `GET /api/user/projects` - Get assigned projects
- `GET /api/user/timesheets` - Get user timesheets for a specific week
- `POST /api/user/timesheets` - Submit timesheet entry

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
- `GET /api/admin/projects` - Get all projects
- `POST /api/admin/projects` - Create new project
- `POST /api/admin/assign-project` - Assign project to user
- `GET /api/admin/timesheets` - Get all timesheets with filtering
- `GET /api/admin/export/csv` - Export timesheets as CSV

## Sample Data

The application comes pre-loaded with:
- 1 Admin user and 2 regular users
- 3 sample projects across different clients
- Sample project assignments

## Development

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Starts the server with nodemon for development
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm start  # Starts the React development server
```

### Building for Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Creates optimized production build
```

## Security Features

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based route protection
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use, modify the PORT environment variable
2. **Database issues**: Delete `timesheet.db` file to reset the database with sample data
3. **CORS issues**: Ensure both frontend and backend are running on their respective ports

### Logs
- Backend logs are displayed in the terminal where you run `npm start`
- Frontend development logs appear in the browser console
